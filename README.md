# Alki-POS
This is my first major Qt-based software. I initially intended it to be a freebie that I would package with my Business venture, I decided against this and have decided to open it to the public so small businesses within my area can benefit from it.It is still under-development and I would still like to add the following

## Current features(to be polished): 
1. Barcode based input
2. Restock module
3. Inventory tracking
4. Custom product-code assignment
5. User restrictions based on privilages 
6. Barcode master list Printing
7. Receipt Printing 
8. Ability of users to use which ever MySQL database they wish to use

## Upcoming features:
1. Sales analytics and Cash flow diagrams/graphs
2. Online back-up database sync feature
3. User account handling
4. Pending Order Queue
5. Price changes
