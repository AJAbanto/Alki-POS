## Alki-POS
This is my first major Qt-based software. I initially intended it to be a freebie that I would package with my Business venture, I decided against this and have decided to open it to the public so small businesses within my area can benefit from it.

# Current features: 
1. Barcode based input
2. Restock module
3. Inventory tracking
4. Custom product-code assignment
5. User restrictions based on privilages 

# It is still under-development and I would still like to add the following:
1. Ability of users to use which ever MySQL database they wish to use
2. Thermal Printer Support
3. Sales analytics and Cash flow diagrams/graphs
4. Online back-up database sync feature
5. Barcode printing
6. User account handling
