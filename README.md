# Alki-POS
This is my first major Qt-based software. I initially intended it to be a freebie that I would package with my Business venture, I decided against this and have decided to open it to the public so small businesses within my area can benefit from it.

Current features: 
-Barcode based input
-Restock module
-Inventory tracking
-Custom product-code assignment
-User restrictions based on privilages 

it is still under-development and I would still like to add the following:
-Ability of users to use which ever MySQL database they wish to use
-Thermal Printer Support
-Sales analytics and Cash flow diagrams/graphs
-Online back-up database sync feature
-Barcode printing
-User account handling
